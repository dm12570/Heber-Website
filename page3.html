                Heber valley rail road is one of the better things to see when you come to heber. <br>
                The heber Valley rail road has a great assortment of activities which they do year round. <br>
                One of these being the Heber Creeper during halloween, and during the christmas time, the <br>
                staff dress up as elves and Santa and ms.Claus.

                The ice Castles are another thing you could see during any winter time in the future or here today. <br>
                During the late fall and early winter, staff members create the ice castles by using a variety of <br>
                different tools with the most important being water (shocking!!!).

                Dairy Keen is one of the best places, in my opinion, to be all year round. <br>
                The food is extremely good and the shakes are great. If you have your family <br>
                with you, you can sit outside in the toy train fit with seats and tables inside.
